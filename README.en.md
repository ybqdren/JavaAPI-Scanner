# About Game

## 1.Title

The package developed by mainstream languages (Python, Java, Go, PHP, JavaScript, etc.) is extracted from the API that is dependent on, and the API extracted from the provided API.

## 3. Description

There must be a compatibility problem between the operating system and the software running on the operating system, and the interface API of the software is one of the key factors affecting the compatibility between the software and the operating system. If the API interface provided by the software itself can be extracted, or the API interface of the software can be called externally, the analysis results of the interface can play a crucial role in the determination of software compatibility.

## 4.Title Requirements

### - Output standard:

Write your own program (Python First) or use an open source program to extract the API of a package developed in a mainstream language (e.g. Mysql is primarily developed by C/C, Ansible is developed by Python, as detailed in http://ic-openlabs.huawei.com/openlab/#/unioncompaty)

### - Technical requirement:

Be familiar with a mainstream language (Python, Java, Go, PHP, JavaScript, etc.), have the ability to read and analyze source code, familiar with a scripting language (Python is best), and can search the Internet to find matching open source projects or related papers as reference and input.
